# AutoGillespie
A sample implementation of the AutoGillespie program in 2D. No copyright. 

Run first the Hopf_Main file, which chemically simulates a bifurcated system undergoing a Hopf bifurcation. This succinctly demonstrates the action of the code by providing stochastic time series data approximating the deterministic system. Base parameters have been chosen to induce a quick termination of the simulation. The "MSc Thesis (Chemical Integration of ODEs)" file contains an original document which motivates and designes the general AutoGillespie Algorithm.
