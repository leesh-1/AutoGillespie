# AutoGillespie
A sample implementation of the AutoGillespie program, redesigned specifically for readability. No copyright. 

Run first the Hopf_Main file, which chemically simulates a bifurcated system undergoing a Hopf bifurcation. This will allow the users to get a grasp of what the code does. The sample AutoGillespie code, implemented for 2D polynomial systems, is segmented into individual files to allow for easy reading and editing. 

The "MSc Thesis (Chemical Integration of ODEs)" file contains an original document which also motivates, and designes, a general AutoGillespie Algorithm. (As the name suggests, it is the Masters Thesis of the author of AutoGillespie)
